# Parad0x
This is a simple scanner to mass infect devices.

This only took me 10 minutes to create on Twitch while streaming.

This is just to show you how easy it is to create botnets and infect devices to cause major damage.

Please do not use this for any illegal purposes, this should only be used as a proof of concept and not be used in a malicous manner. 

If done so, I hold no responsibility for your actions.

This is just for research security and to prove a point: update your devices if possible.

Thanks.

# How to use
Go to Shodan.io, get your API key.

Edit the file apikey.py and enter your Shodan API key in between the single quotes.

Now run Paradox.py with python.

Exploits can be placed in the exploits folder. You just have to edit Paradox.py choices section to execute the exploit command but with the result IP address.

Done.

# Notes
Also, this is simple for one reason. It isn't meant to be actually used.
